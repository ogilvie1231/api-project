<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Visit the Giphy site to find your favorite Gifs. Upon entering you will have 10 preloaded buttons to utilize. Click on any of them and a list of 10 gifs will be displayed. They are in a still state until you click on the gif. Upon clicking, the gif will pause and play. Don't see the topic you are looking for? No problem, use the search box to find a gif on the topic of your choosing. After you search, a new button for your topic will be created. Not all gifs are created equal so be sure to check the rating before you play it!</p>
